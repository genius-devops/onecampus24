    "Figure 2-8 shows an example where lines 1-8 import Firebase data into a Python \n",

    "v.pop('lastreferrer', None), removes the whole lastreferrer key:value pair \n",

    "those changes.\n",
    "Keep in mind that changes you make to the dictionary in Python have no \n",
    "effect on the file or string from which you loaded the JSON data. If you want to \n",
    "create a new JSON string or file, use the json.dumps() or json.dump() methods \n",

    "\n",
    "Dumping Python Data to JSON\n",
    "So far we’ve talked about bringing JSON data from the outside world into your app \n",
    "so Python can use its data. There may be times where you want to go the oppo\u0002site direction, to take some data that’s already in your app in a dictionary format \n",
    "and export it out to JSON to pass to another app, the public at large, or whatever. \n",
    "This is where the json.dump() and json.dumps() methods come into play. The \n",
    "dumps() method creates a JSON string of the data, which is still in memory where \n",
    "you can print() it to see it. For example, the previous code examples imported \n",
    "a Firebase database to a Python dictionary, then looped through that diction\u0002ary changing all the timestamps to mm/dd/yyyy dates, and also removing all the \n",
    "lastreferrer key:value pairs. So let’s say you want to create a JSON string \n",
    "of this new dictionary. You could use dumps like this to create a string named \n",
    "new_dict, and you could also print that string to the console. The last two lines of \n",
    "code outside the loop would be:\n",
    "#Looping is done, copy new dictionary to JSON string.\n",
    "new_dict = json.dumps(hits)\n",
    "print(new_dict)\n",
    "The new_dict string would show in its native, not-very-readable format, which \n",

    "Wee replaced some of the data with ... because you don’t need to see all the items \n",
    "to see how unreadable it looks.\n",
    "Fortunately, the .dumps() method supports an indent= option in which you can \n",
    "specify how you want to indent the JSON data to make it more readable. Two spaces \n",
    "is usually sufficient. For example, add indent=2 to the code above as follows:\n",

    "13.4 JavaScript Object Notation - JSON\n",
    "The JSON format was inspired by the object and array format used in the\n",
    "JavaScript language. But since Python was invented before JavaScript, Python’s\n",
    "syntax for dictionaries and lists influenced the syntax of JSON. So the format of\n",
    "JSON is nearly identical to a combination of Python lists and dictionaries.\n",
    "Here is a JSON encoding that is roughly equivalent to the simple XML from above:\n",
    "{\n",
    "\"name\" : \"Chuck\",\n",
    "\"phone\" : {\n",
    "\"type\" : \"intl\",\n",
    "\"number\" : \"+1 734 303 4456\"\n",
    "},\n",
    "\"email\" : {\n",
    "\"hide\" : \"yes\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "}\n",
    "You will notice some differences. First, in XML, we can add attributes like “intl”\n",
    "to the “phone” tag. In JSON, we simply have key-value pairs. Also the XML\n",
    "“person” tag is gone, replaced by a set of outer curly braces.\n",
    "In general, JSON structures are simpler than XML because JSON has fewer ca￾pabilities than XML. But JSON has the advantage that it maps directly to some\n",
    "combination of dictionaries and lists. And since nearly all programming languages\n",
    "have something equivalent to Python’s dictionaries and lists, JSON is a very nat￾ural format to have two cooperating programs exchange data.\n",
    "JSON is quickly becoming the format of choice for nearly all data exchange between\n",
    "applications because of its relative simplicity compared to XML.\n",
    "13.5 Parsing JSON\n",
    "We construct our JSON by nesting dictionaries (objects) and lists as needed. In\n",
    "this example, we represent a list of users where each user is a set of key-value pairs\n",
    "(i.e., a dictionary). So we have a list of dictionaries.\n",
    "In the following program, we use the built-in json library to parse the JSON and\n",
    "read through the data. Compare this closely to the equivalent XML data and code\n",
    "above. The JSON has less detail, so we must know in advance that we are getting a\n",
    "list and that the list is of users and each user is a set of key-value pairs. The JSON\n",
    "is more succinct (an advantage) but also is less self-describing (a disadvantage).\n",
    "import json\n",
    "input = '''\n",

    "for item in info:\n",
    "print('Name', item['name'])\n",
    "print('Id', item['id'])\n",
    "print('Attribute', item['x'])\n",
    "# Code: http://www.pythonlearn.com/code3/json2.py\n",
    "If you compare the code to extract data from the parsed JSON and XML you will\n",
    "see that what we get from json.loads() is a Python list which we traverse with a\n",
    "for loop, and each item within that list is a Python dictionary. Once the JSON\n",
    "has been parsed, we can use the Python index operator to extract the various bits\n",
    "of data for each user. We don’t have to use the JSON library to dig through the\n",
    "parsed JSON, since the returned data is simply native Python structures.\n",
    "The output of this program is exactly the same as the XML version above.\n",

    "Id 001\n",
    "Attribute 2\n",
    "Name Brent\n",
    "Id 009\n",
    "Attribute 7\n",
    "In general, there is an industry trend away from XML and towards JSON for web\n",
    "services. Because the JSON is simpler and more directly maps to native data struc￾tures we already have in programming languages, the parsing and data extraction\n",
    "code is usually simpler and more direct when using JSON. But XML is more self￾descriptive than JSON and so there are some applications where XML retains an\n",
    "advantage. For example, most word processors store documents internally using\n",
    "XML rather than JSON.\n",
    "13.6 Application Programming Interfaces\n",
    "We now have the ability to exchange data between applications using HyperText\n",

    "The next step is to begin to define and document “contracts” between applications\n",
    "using these techniques. The general name for these application-to-application con￾tracts is Application Program Interfaces or APIs. When we use an API, generally\n",
    "one program makes a set of services available for use by other applications and\n",

    "Ideas for Similar Programs\n",
    "You can walk a directory tree and add files to compressed ZIP archives in \n",
    "several other programs. For example, you can write programs that do the \n",
    "following:\n",
    "•\t Walk a directory tree and archive just files with certain extensions, such \n",

    "•\t Walk a directory tree and archive every file except the .txt and .py ones\n",

    "Summary\n",
    "Even if you are an experienced computer user, you probably handle files \n",
    "manually with the mouse and keyboard. Modern file explorers make it easy \n",
    "to work with a few files. But sometimes you’ll need to perform a task that \n",
    "would take hours using your computer’s file explorer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The os and shutil modules offer functions for copying, moving, \n",
    "renaming, and deleting files. When deleting files, you might want to use \n",
    "the send2trash module to move files to the recycle bin or trash rather than \n",
    "permanently deleting them. And when writing programs that handle files, \n",
    "it’s a good idea to comment out the code that does the actual copy/move/\n",
    "rename/delete and add a print() call instead so you can run the program \n",
    "and verify exactly what it will do.\n",
    "Often you will need to perform these operations not only on files in \n",
    "one folder but also on every folder in that folder, every folder in those fold\u0002ers, and so on. The os.walk() function handles this trek across the folders \n",
    "for you so that you can concentrate on what your program needs to do with \n",
    "the files in them.\n",
    "The zipfile module gives you a way of compressing and extracting files \n",
    "in .zip archives through Python. Combined with the file-handling functions \n",
    "of os and shutil, zipfile makes it easy to package up several files from any\u0002where on your hard drive. These .zip files are much easier to upload to web\u0002sites or send as email attachments than many separate files.\n",
    "Previous chapters of this book have provided source code for you to copy. \n",
    "But when you write your own programs, they probably won’t come out per\u0002fectly the first time. The next chapter focuses on some Python modules that \n",
    "will help you analyze and debug your programs so that you can quickly get \n",
    "them working correctly.\n",
    "Practice Questions\n",
    "1. What is the difference between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "2. What function is used to rename files?\n",

    "4. ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close()\n",

    "Selective Copy\n",
    "Write a program that walks through a folder tree and searches for files with \n",

    "take up the bulk of the space on your hard drive. If you’re trying to free up \n",
    "Organizing. room on your computer, you’ll get the most bang for your buck by deleting \n",
    "the most massive of the unwanted files. But first you have to find them. \n",
    "Write a program that walks through a folder tree and searches for excep\u0002tionally large files or folders—say, ones that have a file size of more than \n",
    "100MB. (Remember, to get a file’s size, you can use os.path.getsize() from \n",
    "the os module.) Print these files with their absolute path to the screen.\n",
    "Filling in the Gaps\n",
    "Write a program that finds all files with a given prefix, such as spam001.txt, \n",
    "spam002.txt, and so on, in a single folder and locates any gaps in the num\u0002bering (such as if there is a spam001.txt and spam003.txt but no spam002.txt). \n",

    "In this chapter, we learned the following:\n",
    "• Lists are used to keep track of zero or more objects. We call the\n",
    "objects in a list its elements and refer to them by position using\n",
    "indices ranging from zero to one less than the length of the list.\n",
    "• Lists are mutable, which means that their contents can be modi-\n",
    "fied. Lists can contain any type of data, including other lists.\n",
    "• Slicing is used to create new lists that have the same values or a\n",
    "subset of the values of the originals.\n",
    "• When two variables refer to the same object, we call them aliases.\n",
    "• Tuples are another kind of Python sequence. Tuples are similar to\n",
    "lists, except they are immutable.\n",
    "• When files are opened and read, their contents are commonly\n",
    "stored in lists of strings.\n",

    "\n",
    "A database is a file that is organized for storing data. Many databases are organized like a dictionary in the sense that they map from keys to values. The biggest difference between a database and a dictionary is that the database is on disk (or other permanent storage), so it persists after the program ends. The module dbm provides an interface for creating and updating database files. As an example, I’ll create a database that contains captions for image files. Opening a database is similar to opening other files:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> import dbm\n",
    ">>> db = dbm.open('captions', 'c')\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    ">>> db['cleese.png']\n",
    "b'Photo of John Cleese.'\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a bytes object, which is why it begins with b. A bytes object is similar to a string in many ways. When you get farther into Python, the difference becomes important, but for now we can ignore it. If you make another assignment to an existing key, dbm replaces the old value:\n",

    "\n",
    "def linecount(filename):\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "    for line in open(filename):\n",

    "print(linecount('wc.py'))\n",
    "\n",
    "#If you run this program, it reads itself and prints the number of lines in the file, which\n",
    "is 7. You can also import it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "import wc\n",
    "7\n",
    "Now you have a module object wc:\n",
    ">>> wc\n",

    "\n",
    "The module object provides linecount:\n",
    ">>> wc.linecount('wc.py')\n",
    "7\n",
    "So that’s how you write modules in Python.\n",
    "The only problem with this example is that when you import the module it runs the\n",
    "test code at the bottom. Normally when you import a module, it defines new func‐\n",
    "tions but it doesn’t run them.\n",
    "Programs that will be imported as modules often use the following idiom:\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    " print(linecount('wc.py'))\n",
    "__name__ is a built-in variable that is set when the program starts. If the program is\n",
    "running as a script, __name__ has the value '__main__'; in that case, the test code\n",
    "runs. Otherwise, if the module is being imported, the test code is skipped.\n",
    "As an exercise, type this example into a file named wc.py and run it as a script. Then\n",
    "run the Python interpreter and import wc. What is the value of __name__ when the\n",
    "module is being imported?\n",
    "Warning: If you import a module that has already been imported, Python does noth‐\n",
    "ing. It does not re-read the file, even if it has changed.\n",
    "If you want to reload a module, you can use the built-in function reload, but it can\n",

    "with backslash sequences:\n",
    ">>> print(repr(s))\n",
    "'1 2\\t 3\\n 4'\n",
    "This can be helpful for debugging.\n",
    "One other problem you might run into is that different systems use different charac‐\n",
